# Participedia Server

Welcome to Participedia!

Participedia is a site for tracking democratic participation around the world.
Right now it is undergoing a significant refactoring and this code may or may
not give you a running system just yet.

[Narrator's Voice: It will not give you a running system.]

Documentation formerly in the README has been updated and moved to the
[Wiki](https://github.com/participedia/api/wiki) for ease of maintenance and
organization.
