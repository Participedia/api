      <p>To conduct an advanced search, use the following syntax:</p>

      <p>AND: bicycle and rally (this is the default, so the same as bicycle rally) will return items which match both words</p>

      <p>OR: bicycle or rally will match items with either or both words</p>

      <p>NOT: bicycle not rally will match items which contain bicycle, but only if they do not also contain rally</p>

      <p>QUOTES: womens rights will return items that have womens followed by rights</p>

      <p>PARENTHESES: (bicycle or rally) and (womens rights and UK) will will group logical operations inside the parentheses as a group before applying the operators joining groups</p>`
