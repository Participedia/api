Please help us complete it. </em></p><h3>Definition</h3><p>Developed by Dr. Edward de Bono, the Six Thinking Hats technique allows participants to approach a discussion from different view points, mental conditions, and ways of thinking.</p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p>Ideal for use when there are multiple competing points of view on the topic of deliberation. The process ensures that a conclusion is reached through rigourous critical-thinking rather than emotion and pre-conception. </p><h3>History</h3><p>A case study of this techniques use during a consensus forum on school infrastructure in Western Australia is available at <a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/cases/scarborough-senior-high-school-redevelopment\">http://participedia.net/en/cases/scarborough-senior-high-school-redevelo...</a></p><h3>Participant Selection Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>There are six different 'hats' participants are asked to don when thinking about the issue:</p><ol><li>The White Hat: parses out what information is known or needed. </li><li>The Red Hat: approaches the topic on hunches, emotions, and intuition.</li><li>The Black Hat: plays the devil's advocate; considers various reasons why something might not work.</li><li>The Yellow Hat: considers the proposed outcomes optimistically.</li><li>The Green Hat: focusses on creativity and innovation; asks about new ideas and alternative possibilities. </li><li>The Blue Hat: manages the thinking process; condenses what has been brought up and how it was arrived at.</li></ol><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>By switching mental 'thinking hats', de Bono claims that participants can expect to:</p><ul><li>\"Hold critical meetings without emotions or egos making bad decisions</li><li>Avoid the easy but mediocre decisions by knowing how to dig deeper</li><li>Increase productivity and even more important -- be more effective</li><li>Make creative solutions the norm</li><li>Maximize and organize each person's thoughts and ideas</li><li>Get to the right solution quickly and with a shared vision\"</li></ul><p>Source: de Bono, Edward, \"Six Thinking Hats\". <a href=\"http://www.debonothinkingsystems.com/tools/6hats.htm\">http://www.debonothinkingsystems.com/tools/6hats.htm</a></p><h3>Analysis and Lessons Learned Secondary Sources</h3><p>de Bono, Edward, \"Six Thinking Hats\". de Bono Thinking Systems <a href=\"http://www.debonothinkingsystems.com/tools/6hats.htm\">http://www.debonothinkingsystems.com/tools/6hats.htm</a></p><h3>External Links Notes</h3>",
