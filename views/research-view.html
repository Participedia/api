  <h1>Research</h1>
  <h2>Participedia is guided by the research question: What kinds of participatory processes work best, for what purposes, and under what conditions?</h2>

  {{#> accordion title="Methodology"}}
    <p>The strategy is simple: crowdsource data on democratic innovations from around the world and then aggregate this into a public database that continually updates with new contributions. All of Participedia’s content and data is open source.</p>

    <p>For an in-depth explanation of the history, aspirations, theory and analytical approach of Participedia, see [needs-link]The Participedia Project: An Introduction [/needs-link], by the two founders of Participedia, Archon Fung and Mark E. Warren.</p>

  {{#> accordion title="Data Repository"}}
    <p>A great deal of research on democratic innovations is not publicly available. This includes large datasets, graduate and postgraduate dissertations, and practitioner evaluations and reports. We aim to find a home for such research in an accessible data repository.</p>

  {{#> accordion title="Surveys"}}
    <p>Surveys are supplementary to Participedia’s current data and narrative descriptions and are intended to gain further insight on the outcomes and effects of cases.</p>

    <p>The participant survey will capture the experience of participants directly involved in a participatory process. It could be delivered by organizers at the location of a particular process, or participants could be asked to complete the survey after the event.</p>

    <p>The observer survey will capture views pertaining to the broader impact of a particular case. ‘Observers’ include practitioners, participants or researchers with particular knowledge of that case.</p>

    <p>Participedia's surveys are undergoing testing, and will be available for download soon.</p>
