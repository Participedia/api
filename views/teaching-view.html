    <h2>Participedia in the Classroom</h2>

    <p>Writing or editing Participedia entries can be a great assignment for courses that deal with political participation, democratic innovation, or deliberation.</p>

    <p>In the course of selecting, researching, and writing up a case, method, or organization, students will learn about the substance of participation in varied contexts. Students may also find it rewarding to have their work showcased on Participedia.</p>

    <p>The following resources offer ideas on how to enhance course offerings about public participation:</p>
