    <h2>Participedia in the Classroom</h2>

    <p>Writing or editing articles for Participedia can be a great assignment for courses that deal with political participation, democratic innovation, or deliberation.</p>

    <p>In the course of selecting, researching, and writing up a case, method, or organization, students will learn about the substance of participation in varied contexts. Students may also find it rewarding to have their work showcased on Participedia.</p>

    <p>Participedia’s Teaching Training and Mentoring Committee has collected a variety of resources from the academic community. Feel free to adjust the material to suit your class’s needs.</p>

    <h2>Teaching & Learning Resource Centre</h2>

    <p>Coming soon! Like cases, methods and organizations, anyone will be able to publish teaching and learning resources to share with the Participedia community.</p>

    <p>Currently, Participedia is collecting tools for educators and learners, including course syllabi, sample assignments and more, to enhance course offerings about public participation as well as participatory teaching practices in other subjects. These resources can be applied in early to post-secondary education settings, as well as professional development for NGOs, civil society organizations, and practitioners.</p>

    <p>These resources can be used to:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Improve students’ knowledge of innovations in participatory democracy, while also improving their research and writing skills by publishing cases, methods and organizations on Participedia;</li>
      <li>Focus on Participedia content and its connection to relevant theoretical material;</li>
      <li>Prepare students to be organizers and researchers of democratic innovations, and;</li>
      <li>Shape pedagogy and classroom culture to be more participatory.</li>
